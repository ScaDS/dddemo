    <p class="slide-intro" style="flex: 1; margin-bottom: 0;">The computational requirements and the trade-off between detection of drift and compute effort is currently investigated in the research community.

      <br>

      Werner et al. have published <a href="https://imageseg.scads.ai/omniax/conceptdrift/" target="_blank">a website</a> for their ongoing work that considers concept drift detection in a benchmark using Bayesian optimization to identify drift detector configurations that balance between runtime and accuracy of a machine learning model in the data processing pipeline.</p>
